Hello! I'm a junior undergraduate student at the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), fortunately supervised by [Prof. Zuchao Li](https://zcli-charlie.github.io/).

My research interests include **natural language processing**, **large language model（LLM）**, **youth safety and alignment**, **LLM music**, and **efficient fine-tuning**.

<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"><strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600">I am currently on the 2023-2024 academic job market, looking for faculty positions in CS, CSE, ECE, IEOR, etc., related to Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested. I am also happy to give talks on my research in related seminars.</strong></strong>
